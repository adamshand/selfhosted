# Popularity Tracker for Self Hosted Applications

[r/selfhosted/](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) is a popular forum which helps people host applications on their own servers. Some of the people on the forum are professional sysadmins or developers, but many people who run their own applications (email, chat, documents, photos, etc) for the increased sense of privacy, security, and control over the applications which many of use and rely on.

One of the most common questions from newcomers to the forum is some version of "what should I host?"  There are some common answers to this question but I thought it would be interesting to ask selfhosters to report on what they actually run and provide a webpage with a leaderboard of the most popular applications.
